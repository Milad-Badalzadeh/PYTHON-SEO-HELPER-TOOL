> HI 


**THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT ON GITHUB**

**(A PYTHON BOT FOR FINDING THE SEARCH VOLUMES OF KEYWORDS IN GOOGLE)**

**It can help you with SEO**


> It's easy to get it to work ;

> 1 . download the project and extract it to the Desktop folder

> 2 . open words.txt and (paste or write) your target words

> 3 . run the VOLUME_API.py

> 4 . the results will be saved in a CSV file in the Desktop folder.



0 . YOU should have a (https://dataforseo.com) account, API login, and password and put it in the code.
0. DON'T WORRY I DID PUT MY API LOGIN AND PASS IN THE CODE, THUS TEST IF IT DOESN'T WORK GO AND GET YOUR OWN FREE API KEYS.

I appreciate any sort of help to make the bot professional so if you have any ideas let me know.

Let's BUILD A GIANT SEO TOOL TOGETHER.


best regards.
